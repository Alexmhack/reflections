this makes the directory a git repository

add those files to staging area when there is a logic you want to change in 
the file and seperate the un-related files from each other

you can add one or more than one file to the staging area.

e.g. add a new object for Game class

What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

git creates a .git folder iniside the directory.
it is needed to make our directory a git repository through which we can use
version-control on our projects.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

staging area is that place where you put the files in which you want to make
some logical changes and those changes are significant enough to be commited
seperately.
In this place you can commit the changes.
